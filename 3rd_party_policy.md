## Policies to Assure 3rd Parties Support Ratchet Compliance

1. The following steps are required before 3rd parties are granted access to any Ratchet systems:
	* Due diligence with the 3rd party;
	* Controls implemented to maintain compliance;
	* Written agreements, with appropriate security requirements, are executed.
2. All connections and data in transit between the Ratchet Platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. Access granted to external parties is limited to the minimum necessary and granted only for the duration required.
4. A standard business associate agreement with Customers and Partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organizationâ€™s security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
5. Ratchet has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with Subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
7. Third parties are unable to make changes to any Ratchet infrastructure without explicit permission from Ratchet. Additionally, no Ratchet Customers or Partners have access outside of their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete anything related to other 3rd parties. 
8. Whenever outsourced development is utilized by Ratchet, all changes to production systems will be approved and implemented by Ratchet workforce members only. All outsourced development requires a formal contract with Ratchet.
9. Ratchet maintains and annually reviews a list all current Partners and Subcontractors.
10. Ratchet assesses security requirements and compliance considerations with all Partners and Subcontracts.
11. Regular review is conducted as required by SLAs to assure security and compliance. These reviews include reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures and disruptions, and identified issues are investigated and resolved in a reasonable and timely manner.
13. Any changes to Partner and Subcontractor services and systems are reviewed before implementation.
14. For all partners, Ratchet reviews activity annually to assure partners are in line with SLAs in contracts with Ratchet.
