# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Ratchet understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Ratchet is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Ratchet has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Ratchet Customers to support data retention laws.
